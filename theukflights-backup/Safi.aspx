Scheduled Airline Failure will therefore not be operative where the tickets were issued after the 24th May 2007. All cover will still be operative where the tickets have been issued prior to the 25th May 2007, irrespective of the date of travel. We would stress that this is purely a precautionary measure, as no formal announcement has been made by the Airline and this notice should not in any way be taken as a few of the financial standing of the Airline.</td>
