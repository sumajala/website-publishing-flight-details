It can take more time to obtain a visa, so you are  advised to apply before 60days of your departure date; we accept no  responsibility for customers who do not possess the correct documents.<br /><br />
          A  valid passport is necessary for travel, some countries require that your  passport should be valid for a minimum 6 months after you enter that country, if your passport has less than a year to run, we advise you confirm the requirements of the destination  before making final travel plans, and arrange to renew your passport if  necessary.

          Children not already  included on a valid British passport will need to hold their own passport if  they are to travel abroad. Children who were included on a passport&nbsp;before 5 October 1998 may continue  to travel with the passport holder until: <br /><br />
          The child reaches the age of  16; or&nbsp;The passport on which the child is included  expires; or&nbsp;The passport on which the child is included is  replaced or an amendment results in the issue of a new passport The  name on the passport must match the name on the ticket, otherwise you may not  be able to travel and insurance may be invalid. If, after making a booking but  before travelling, any member of your party changes their name; we must be  notified immediately so that we can try to make the necessary changes to your  holiday documentation.

The UK Flights will  send you a confirmation email with your booking reference number and E-ticket  number, which serves as a receipt for your e-ticket. You will&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;receive a physical 'e-ticket' or paper  tickets to present at the airport.

During the booking process, you will be given  the choice of e-ticket or paper ticket.&nbsp;Please  note that airlines have their own rules and regulations with regard to  e-ticketing. The UK Flights cannot be held responsible for non-compliance with  these rules and regulations and strongly recommends that you check these  details with your airline in advance of travel. <br /><br />
          Ticket Delivery<strong> </strong><br /><br />
          The UK  Flights on the information that you provide as  being accurate and therefore cannot be held responsible if your paper tickets  are lost due to an incorrect address or your e-ticket does not arrive due to an  incorrect email address or your junk email settings. You must notify us  immediately if you change your email address or contact telephone number. In  addition, please check that the name on your passport matches the name on your  ticket and/or booking confirmation. Please note that <strong>The UK Flights</strong> does  not deliver paper tickets outside the UK. Also, if you have any special  delivery requirements (such as flats with security gates) then you should  advise us of this immediately after booking. It is your responsibility to  advise us if you have not received your tickets. If you hold any other booking,  either with The UK Flights or another  agent, then it is your responsibility to advise us that you need tickets from  us by a certain time. The UK Flights would  recommend that you do this before completing the booking. This will help us  decide if express delivery is required.&nbsp;</p></td>
